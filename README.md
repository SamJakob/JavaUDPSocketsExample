# Java UDP Sockets Example
This is an example project demonstrating how to communicate between a Java
server and client with a UDP socket.

This is a very bare-bones example that does not account for the unreliability
of UDP. It is expected that this example would be improved upon to incorporate
that.

This is written and tested with Java 16, however if you're using an older Java
version the only necessary change should be replacing use of `var` in the code
with the data type (i.e., the class name).

- [`ScuffedProtocol.java`](./src/com/samjakob/sockets_example/ScuffedProtocol.java):
  is a stub class that simply has a constant for the
  port number of the protocol.
- [`MyClient.java`](./src/com/samjakob/sockets_example/MyClient.java):
  is a runnable Java file that contains a simple client
  implementation that allows a user to enter messages to send to a server
  and prints any received messages from the server.
- [`MyServer.java`](./src/com/samjakob/sockets_example/MyServer.java):
  is a runnable Java file that contains a simple server
  implementation that converts any received messages to CAPITALS and sends
  the updated message back to the client.
